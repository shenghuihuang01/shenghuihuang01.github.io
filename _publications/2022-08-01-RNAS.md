Abstract: The vulnerability of Deep Neural Networks, i.e., susceptibility to adversarial attacks, severely limits the application of DNNs in security-sensitive domains. Most of existing methods improve model robustness from weight optimization, such as adversarial training. However, the architecture of DNNs is also a key factor to robustness, which is often neglected or underestimated. We propose Robust Network Architecture Search (RNAS) to obtain a robust network against adversarial attacks. We observe that an adversarial perturbation distorting the non-robust features in latent feature space can further aggravate misclassification. Based on this observation, we search the robust architecture through restricting feature distortion in the search process. Specifically, we define a network vulnerability metric based on feature distortion as a constraint in the search process. This process is modeled as a multi-objective bilevel optimization problem and a novel algorithm is proposed to solve this optimization. Extensive experiments conducted on CIFAR-10/100 and SVHN show that RNAS achieves the best robustness under various adversarial attacks compared with extensive baselines and SOTA methods.
